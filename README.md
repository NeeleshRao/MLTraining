# MLTraining
This repository contains all the code that I wrote while learning different ML models.

The models learnt are:
1. KNN
2. SVM
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forest
5. Linear Regression
6. Logistic Regression

Additionally, I also learnt about data cleaning and preporcessing for preparation of dataset. This was achieved using pandas dataframes.
