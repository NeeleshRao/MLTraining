# MLTraining
This repository contains all the code that I wrote while learning different ML models.

The models learnt are:
1. KNN
2. SVM
3. Bayes Theorem
4. Decision Trees
5. Random Forest
6. Linear Regression
7. Logistic Regression

Additionally, I also learnt about data cleaning and preporcessing for preparation of dataset. This was achieved using pandas dataframes.
